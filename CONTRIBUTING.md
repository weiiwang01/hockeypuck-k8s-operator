# Contributing

## Overview

This document explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing enhancements to the hockeypuck-k8s charm.

- Generally, before developing enhancements to this charm, you should consider [opening an issue
  ](https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator/issues) explaining your use case.
- If you would like to chat with us about your use-cases or proposed implementation, you can reach
  us at [Canonical Matrix public channel](https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-charmdev:ubuntu.com)
  or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
- Familiarizing yourself with the [Charmed Operator Framework](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/howto/manage-charms/index.html#build-a-charm) library
  will help you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically examines
  - code quality
  - test coverage
  - user experience for Juju operators of this charm.
- Once your pull request is approved, we squash and merge your pull request branch onto
  the `main` branch. This creates a linear Git commit history.
- For further information on contributing, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/canonical/is-charms-contributing-guide).

## Code of conduct

When contributing, you must abide by the
[Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct).

## Canonical contributor agreement

Canonical welcomes contributions to the Hockeypuck charm. Please check out our
[contributor agreement](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors) if you're interested in contributing to the solution.

## Releases and versions

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Please ensure that any new feature, fix, or significant change is documented by
adding an entry to the [CHANGELOG.md](link-to-changelog) file.

To learn more about changelog best practices, visit [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## Submissions

If you want to address an issue or a bug in this project,
notify in advance the people involved to avoid confusion;
also, reference the issue or bug number when you submit the changes.

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
  our [GitHub repository](link-to-github-repo)
  and add the changes to your fork, properly structuring your commits,
  providing detailed commit messages and signing your commits.
- Make sure the updated project builds and runs without warnings or errors;
  this includes linting, documentation, code and tests.
- Submit the changes as a
  [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Your changes will be reviewed in due time; if approved, they will be eventually merged.

### Describing pull requests

To be properly considered, reviewed and merged,
your pull request must provide the following details:

- **Title**: Summarize the change in a short, descriptive title.

- **Overview**: Describe the problem that your pull request solves.
  Mention any new features, bug fixes or refactoring.

- **Rationale**: Explain why the change is needed.

- **Juju Events Changes**: Describe any changes made to Juju events, or
  "None" if the pull request does not change any Juju events.

- **Module Changes**: Describe any changes made to the module, or "None"
  if your pull request does not change the module.

- **Library Changes**: Describe any changes made to the library,
  or "None" is the library is not affected.

- **Checklist**: Complete the following items:

  - The [charm style guide](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/styleguide) was applied
  - The [contributing guide](https://github.com/canonical/is-charms-contributing-guide) was applied
  - The changes are compliant with [ISD054 - Managing Charm Complexity](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/specification-isd014-managing-charm-complexity/11619)
  - The documentation is updated
  - The PR is tagged with appropriate label (trivial, senior-review-required)
  - The changelog has been updated

### Signing commits

To improve contribution tracking,
we use the developer certificate of origin
([DCO 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/))
and require a "sign-off" for any changes going into each branch.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the commit message
certifying that you wrote it
or have the right to commit it as an open-source contribution.

To sign off on a commit, follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).


## Developing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working [development setup](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/tutorial/#set-up-an-isolated-test-environment).

The code for this charm can be downloaded as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator.git
```

You can use the environments created by `tox` for development:

```shell
tox --notest -e unit
source .tox/unit/bin/activate
```

You can create an environment for development with `python3-venv`:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
```

Install `tox` inside the virtual environment for testing.

### Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

* `tox`: Runs all of the basic checks (`lint`, `unit`, `static`, and `coverage-report`).
* `tox -e fmt`: Runs formatting using `black` and `isort`.
* `tox -e lint`: Runs a range of static code analysis to check the code.
* `tox -e static`: Runs other checks such as `bandit` for security issues.
* `tox -e unit`: Runs the unit tests.
* `tox -e integration`: Runs the integration tests.

### Building the charm

Build the charm in this git repository using:

```shell
charmcraft pack
```

For the integration tests (and also to deploy the charm locally), the Hockeypuck
image is required in the MicroK8s registry. To enable it, run:

```shell
microk8s enable registry
```

Use [Rockcraft](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/) to create an
OCI image for the Hockeypuck app, and then upload the image to the MicroK8s registry,
which stores OCI archives so they can be downloaded and deployed. The following commands
pack the OCI image and push the image into the registry:

```shell
cd [project_dir]/hockeypuck_rock && rockcraft pack
rockcraft.skopeo --insecure-policy copy --dest-tls-verify=false oci-archive:hockeypuck_0.2_amd64.rock docker://localhost:32000/hockeypuck:0.2
```

### Deploying

```bash
# Create a model
juju add-model hockeypuck-test
# Enable DEBUG logging
juju model-config logging-config="<root>=INFO;unit=DEBUG"
# Deploy the charm (assuming you're on amd64)
juju deploy ./hockeypuck-k8s_amd64.charm --resource app-image=localhost:32000/hockeypuck:0.2 --config metrics-port=9626 --config app-port=11371
```
