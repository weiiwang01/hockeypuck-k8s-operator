# Terraform modules

This project contains the [Terraform][Terraform] modules to deploy the 
[Hockeypuck charm][Hockeypuck charm] with its dependencies.

The modules use the [Terraform Juju provider][Terraform Juju provider] to model
the bundle deployment onto any Kubernetes environment managed by [Juju][Juju].

## Module structure

- **main.tf** - Defines the Juju application to be deployed.
- **variables.tf** - Allows customization of the deployment including Juju model name, charm's channel and configuration.
- **output.tf** - Responsible for integrating the module with other Terraform modules, primarily by defining potential integration endpoints (charm integrations).
- **versions.tf** - Defines the Terraform provider.
